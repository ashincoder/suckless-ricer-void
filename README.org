* Why did I make this?

This is a bootstrapping script for making my life easier for void linux. This compiles and install all the my dependencies and my suckless utilities.

* How to work it?

Nothing to do :

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/ashincoder/suckless-ricer-void
cd suckless-ricer-void
./installer.sh
#+end_example

That's it.
